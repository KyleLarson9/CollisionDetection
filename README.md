Description

This project demonstrates a collision detection system in Java that can be used for larger projects and has more features than the built-in intersects method.

Features

   1. Parametric Equations: To determine the point of intersection of two line segments
   2. Data Storage: Multiple array lists were used to store vertices of line segments from more complex shapes and collision points.
   3. Java Swing: Used to develop the Graphical User Interface and components.

Why I Developed the Project

I developed this project because the built-in intersects method wasn't enough for several projects I wanted to do. The intersects method was limited because it didn't give any information about where the collision occurred on the shape or line segment. So, I wanted to develop my own collision system with these types of features so I could use and access that data as needed.

What I Learned

This project taught me about implementing more complex math into code and creating more useful conditional expressions from this information. It provided me with insights into algorithmic development to perform specific tasks like finding collision points of line segments and being able to use that to find collision points of more complex shapes. In this project, I also tried to focus on creating smaller and more specific methods and classes, and overall keeping a more organized and documented code with more descriptive comments.
